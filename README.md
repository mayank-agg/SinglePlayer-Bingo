- This is an android application built using corona sdk (a cross platform network). 

- The application provides an interactive UI to users for a unique experience of playing bingo.  

- Future ideas involve multiplayer capabilities via the integration of web sockets and a global presence
by connecting the app to a database. 

Testing the app.

- The app can be tested by downloading Corona SDK (free) - a cross-platform framework for Mobile devices.

- Clone the repo and open main.lua using Corona SDK. 

Issues:

- A score system that agrees with "BINGO" events is required. 
- Game can be initiated without selecting the bingo cards. This issue needs to be resolved for a robust application.
