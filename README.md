- This game is built using corona sdk (cross platform framework) for android devices.

- It follows all rules of a typical bingo game. However, it provides users with a unique experience through
a very user friendly and interactive UI.

- Future plans involve alowing multiplayer capabilities via the integration of web sockets and a global presence
by having the app connect to a database hosted on a server.

Testing the app.

- To test the app on your computer, you can download Corona SDK (free) - which is a cross-platform framework for Mobile devices.

- Clone the repo and open main.lua using Corona SDK


Issues:

- still need to build a score system that agrees with "BINGO" events.
- Start button will try to start game even if we havn't chosen the bingo cards.
